# SwiftServer_Pizzeria

SwiftServer_Pizzeria is a lightweight Swift-based server application designed for a fictional pizzeria. The server provides several endpoints to simulate real-world functionalities such as viewing menu details, placing orders, and retrieving order history. It is built using the [Swifter](https://github.com/httpswift/swifter) library for handling HTTP requests and responses.

## Features

- **View Pizzeria Information**
  - Endpoint: `/pizza`
  - Returns information about the pizzeria such as name, address, contact details, and opening hours in JSON format.

- **Browse the Menu**
  - Endpoint: `/menu`
  - Provides a comprehensive menu with categorized items (e.g., Pizzas, Salads, Drinks), including details like description, price, and whether the item is vegetarian.

- **Place an Order**
  - Endpoint: `/order`
  - Accepts order details in JSON format and stores it for retrieval. The server logs received orders for confirmation.

- **View the Last Order**
  - Endpoint: `/orders`
  - Displays the last placed order in an HTML table format. Includes a breakdown of items and a calculated total price.
